What she loves most is how her practice makes her feel deeply connected to herself, others, and a sense of the divine, finding space for strength, softness, flow, and stillness. Mia hopes to create a trauma-informed, grounded, and uplifting environment where students cultivate their curiosity, resilience, and self-awareness. Outside of yoga, she is passionate about theater making, being in the mountains, reading, writing, and practicing languages, along with dancing, singing, and spending time with loved ones"

He credits yoga for providing the tools to reclaim himself physically (losing weight and getting strong), mentally (recovering from depression), and emotionally (reconnecting with loved ones). Benjamin’s main goal is for his students to gain even a small amount of this mind-body-spirit connection in his classes. Outside of practice, his passion is his dogs and his garden, which he has transformed into beautiful visual and olfactory oases."

She now focuses on sharing this trauma-informed therapeutic practice of liberation with others. Katherine enjoys the feeling of bringing awareness to her body and breath, which she describes as a loving connection with herself and the Divine, and is sustained by the way her practice nourishes her life and deepens her awareness of her dharma (purpose). In class, she acts as a facilitator and guide, inviting students into a safe and supportive experience, hoping they leave feeling loved, supported, and connected to Divine Love. Outside of yoga, she loves to cook, surf, write, experience the outdoors, sing, dance (she was a Zumba teacher), travel with her family, and has a deep love for the ocean, recently completing her freediving certification."
